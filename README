ep128emu 2.0.2
==============

ep128emu is an open source, portable emulator of the Enterprise 128
computer, written in C++, and supporting Windows and POSIX platforms
(32 bit Windows, and 32 and 64 bit Linux have been tested).
It implements accurate, high quality hardware emulation, however, the
system requirements are higher than that of most other emulators.

Features
========

General
-------

  * graphical user interface using the FLTK library
  * software (FLTK based) or OpenGL video, with resizable emulator
    window, fullscreen mode, brightness/contrast/gamma can be set
    globally or separately for red/green/blue channels, color
    saturation control; additional features in OpenGL mode only: single
    or double buffered (with synchronization to vertical refresh) mode,
    linear texture filtering, and some display effects
  * real time audio output uses the PortAudio library (v18 or v19), with
    support for many native audio APIs (MME/DirectSound/ASIO on Windows,
    OSS/ALSA/JACK on Linux, and CoreAudio on MacOS X); high quality
    sample rate conversion with low aliasing; volume control, two first
    order highpass filters with configurable cutoff frequency, and an
    optional parametric equalizer can be applied to the audio signal
  * recording sound output to a WAV format sound file
  * saving and loading snapshots of the state of the emulated machine
  * demo recording (snapshot combined with stream of keyboard events
    which can be played back with accurate timing)
  * tape emulation with playback, recording, and setting tape position;
    markers can be created for quick positioning to specific tape
    locations (useful for tapes with multiple files); uses custom file
    format which is PCM audio data with 1 to 8 bits of sample resolution
    and variable sample rate, and header including the table of markers
  * GUI tape editor utility for copying Enterprise files from/to
    ep128emu tape images
  * simple GUI debugger with support for breakpoints/watchpoints,
    viewing the current state of CPU registers and memory paging,
    displaying memory dump or loading from or saving to a file in ASCII
    or binary format, modifying memory or searching for a pattern of
    bytes, disassembler with support for all documented and some
    undocumented Z80 opcodes, address offset for code that runs at a
    different location than where it is at the time of disassembling,
    and saving disassembly to a file. For memory operations and the
    disassembler, addresses can be 16 bit CPU (affected by current
    paging) or 22 bit physical (all ROM and RAM data can be accessed,
    regardless of memory paging) addresses. Watchpoints can also be set
    on I/O ports and physical addresses.

Enterprise emulation
--------------------

  * instruction based emulation of the Z80 CPU, supports all documented
    and some undocumented opcodes, and memory wait states (including
    synchronization with the NICK chip when accessing video memory)
  * RAM size can be set in 16 kilobyte steps in the range 64 to 3712
  * ROM can be loaded from external image files to segments 0 to 7,
    16 to 19 (decimal), 32 to 35, and 48 to 51
  * NICK chip emulation, supporting all documented video modes
  * DAVE emulation, including timers, interrupts, external ports for
    tape and keyboard/joystick, memory paging, and sound output (all
    effects are supported, and the polynomial counters generate the same
    pseudo-random "noise" pattern as on the real machine)
  * WD177x (floppy disk controller) emulation for EXDOS
  * optional extension ROM (epfileio.rom) that implements a FILE: device
    for direct access to files on the host system in a single user
    selectable directory
  * Spectrum emulator card emulation
  * real time clock (at ports 7E, 7F)

Installation
============

Linux
-----

On Linux and other POSIX platforms, the emulator is installed from the
source code, available at the SourceForge download page
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128766
or the most recent state of the code can be downloaded from CVS with the
following command:
  cvs -z3 -d                                                        \
  :pserver:anonymous@ep128emu.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ep128emu \
  checkout -P ep128emu2
In addition to the standard development tools (a recent version of the
GNU C/C++ compiler, binutils, etc.), you need the following packages:

  * SCons (http://www.scons.org/)
  * Python interpreter for running SCons
  * FLTK 1.1.x (http://www.fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=1.1.7)
    NOTE: this library should be compiled with the --enable-threads
    'configure' option - many Linux distributions include binaries of
    the FLTK library built without --enable-threads, so you may need to
    compile it from sources
  * PortAudio (http://www.portaudio.com/download.html), version 18 and
    19 are supported, but v19 is recommended
  * libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download)
  * dotconf (http://www.azzit.de/dotconf/)

Once these are installed, you can edit the file 'SConstruct' in the top
level source directory for setting compiler flags etc., and run the
command 'scons' for building the emulator. The resulting executable
files (ep128emu and tapeedit) can be copied to any directory that is in
the PATH, but when installing the first time, you also need to set up
configuration files and ROM images:

  * create the directories ~/.ep128emu, ~/.ep128emu/config, and
    ~/.ep128emu/roms, and optionally ~/.ep128emu/demo, ~/.ep128emu/disk,
    ~/.ep128emu/progs, and ~/.ep128emu/tape
  * copy the file 'roms/epfileio.rom' from the sources to
    ~/.ep128emu/roms
  * download
    http://ep128emu.enterpriseforever.org/roms/ep128emu_roms.zip,
    and extract it to ~/.ep128emu/roms
  * run './makecfg ~/.ep128emu' to create the initial configuration
    files

Windows
-------

A binary package with an installer is available at the SourceForge
download page:
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128766
To install, just run the executable, and follow the instructions.
The installer can automatically download the ROM images needed for
running the emulator, but these can also be installed manually by
downloading
http://ep128emu.enterpriseforever.org/roms/ep128emu_roms.zip, and
extracting it to roms\ under the selected installation folder.
When asked if configuration files should be reinstalled, click 'OK'
when installing the first time, but this step can be skipped in later
installations to preserve the configuration.

Usage
=====

Command line options
--------------------

  -h
  -help
  --help
    print the list of available command line options
  -cfg <FILENAME>
    load an ASCII format configuration file on startup, and apply
    settings
  -opengl
    use OpenGL video driver (this is the default, and is recommended
    when hardware accelerated OpenGL is available)
  -no-opengl
    use software video driver; this is slower than OpenGL when used at
    high resolutions, and also disables many display effects, but should
    work on all machines; however, it will use a color depth of 24 bits,
    while in OpenGL mode the textures are 16 bit (R5G6B5) only, to
    improve performance
  OPTION=VALUE
    set configuration variable 'OPTION' to 'VALUE'; the available
    variable names are the same as those used in ASCII format
    configuration files
  OPTION
    set boolean configuration variable 'OPTION' to true

'File' menu
-----------

Configuration / Load from ASCII file

  Select and load an ASCII format configuration file and apply the new
  settings. If the configuration file does not include all the supported
  options, those that are omitted are left unchanged.

Configuration / Load from binary file

  Load an ep128emu format binary file, which may be a previously saved
  snapshot, demo, or a binary format configuration file.

Configuration / Save as ASCII file

  Save the current emulator configuration to an ASCII text file, which
  can be edited with any text editor, and can be loaded at a later time.

Configuration / Save

  Save the current emulator configuration in binary format to the
  default file (~/.ep128emu/ep128cfg.dat). This is also automatically
  done when exiting the emulator.

Configuration / Revert

  Reload emulator configuration from ~/.ep128emu/ep128cfg.dat, and apply
  the original settings.

Save snapshot

  Save snapshot to the selected file (see notes above).

Load snapshot

  Load an ep128emu format binary file, which may be a previously saved
  snapshot, demo, or a binary format configuration file.

Quick snapshot / Set file name

  Select file name for quick snapshots. The default is
  ~/.ep128emu/qs_ep128.dat. This setting is not saved on exit.

Quick snapshot / Save (Ctrl + F9)

  Save a snapshot of the current state of the emulated machine to the
  quick snapshot file. The snapshot will also include the current memory
  configuration and ROM images, but clock frequency and timing settings
  are not restored when loading a snapshot. The file format may be
  subject to changes between different releases of the emulator. Note
  that the state of any floppy drives is currently not saved, and the
  drives are reset on loading a snapshot.

Quick snapshot / Load (Ctrl + F10)

  Load the quick snapshot file if it exists.

Record demo

  Save snapshot (including clock frequency and timing settings) and
  record keyboard events to the selected file until the recording is
  stopped. The events can be replayed with accurate timing when the
  file is loaded later. Note that the file format may change between
  different releases of the emulator. Events that

Stop demo (Ctrl + F12)

  Stop any currently running demo playback or recording.

Load demo

  Load an ep128emu format binary file, which may be a previously saved
  snapshot, demo, or a binary format configuration file.

Record sound file

  Write 16 bit signed PCM sound output to a WAV format sound file.

Stop sound recording

  Close sound output file if it is currently being written.

Save screenshot

  Save a screenshot in 8 bit RLE compressed TGA format. The video output
  is captured immediately after activating this menu item, and is saved
  at a resolution of 768x576 without any processing (color correction,
  effects, etc.).

Quit

  Exit the emulator.

'Machine' menu
--------------

Reset / Reset (F11)

  This has the same effect as using the reset button on the real
  machine.

Reset / Force reset (Ctrl + F11)

  In addition to a normal reset, make sure that the emulated machine is
  really restarted using the standard ROM reset routines, and do not
  allow programs to disable reset by setting custom (RAM) handlers.

Reset / Reset clock frequencies

  Reset clock frequency and timing settings to those specified in the
  machine configuration; this is normally only useful after demo
  playback, which may override the settings.

Reset / Reset machine configuration (Shift + F11)

  Reset memory configuration (RAM size, ROM images), clock frequency,
  and timing settings according to the machine configuration, and clear
  all RAM data. Implies 'Force reset' and 'Reset clock frequencies'.
  Reverting the configuration can be useful after snapshot loading or
  demo playback, as these may change the settings.

Quick configuration / Load config 1 (PageDown)

  Load the configuration file ~/.ep128emu/epvmcfg1.cfg, and apply the
  new settings.

Quick configuration / Load config 2 (PageUp)

  Load the configuration file ~/.ep128emu/epvmcfg2.cfg, and apply the
  new settings.

Quick configuration / Save config 1

  Save the current clock frequency and timing settings to
  ~/.ep128emu/epvmcfg1.cfg.

Quick configuration / Save config 2

  Save the current clock frequency and timing settings to
  ~/.ep128emu/epvmcfg2.cfg.

'Options' menu
--------------

Display / Set size to 384x288
Display / Set size to 768x576
Display / Set size to 1152x864

  Resize the emulator window to predefined width/height values; this has
  no effect in fullscreen mode. While the window can also be resized
  using the window manager, sizes that are integer multiples of the
  actual screen resolution of the emulated machine may look better,
  particularly when texture filtering is not used, and are also slightly
  faster when using the software video driver.

Display / Cycle display mode (F9)

  Cycle between these four display modes:
    window with no menu bar
    window with menu bar (this is the default)
    fullscreen with menu bar
    fullscreen with no menu bar

Sound / Increase volume

  Increase sound output volume by about 1.5 dB.

Sound / Decrease volume

  Decrease sound output volume by about 1.5 dB.

Floppy / Configure...

  Opens a dialog for setting up floppy emulation. For each drive, an
  image file can be selected, and disk geometry parameters can be
  specified. If the file name is left empty, that means having no disk
  in that particular drive. It may also be possible to directly access a
  real disk by using the /dev/fd* devices (on Linux) or \\.\A: (on
  Windows) as the image file.
  Any of the geometry parameters can be zero or negative to have the
  value calculated automatically from the others (if available), the
  image file size, and the file system header.

Floppy / Remove disk / Drive A
Floppy / Remove disk / Drive B
Floppy / Remove disk / Drive C
Floppy / Remove disk / Drive D
Floppy / Remove disk / All drives

  These are just shortcuts for setting the image file name for a
  specific floppy drive to an empty string.

Floppy / Replace disk / Drive A
Floppy / Replace disk / Drive B
Floppy / Replace disk / Drive C
Floppy / Replace disk / Drive D
Floppy / Replace disk / All drives

  Set the image file name for a specific (or all) floppy drive to an
  empty string, and then set the original file name again. This is
  mostly useful when accessing real floppy disks, after the disk is
  changed.

Set working directory

  Set the directory to be accessed by the optional file I/O ROM
  extension modules.
