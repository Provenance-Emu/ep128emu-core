Changes in version 2.0.2
------------------------

  * implemented Spectrum emulator
  * implemented real time clock
  * in the default keyboard map, Home can also be used now as HOLD, and
    End as STOP; the original keys (Pause/Break and PrintScreen/SysRq)
    did not work on some machines
  * keyboard matrix state is no longer cleared on soft reset
  * NICK registers are initialized to random values on start-up
  * added new ROM images and machine configuration presets
  * the makecfg utility now asks for an installation directory if
    started without command line arguments, and automatically creates
    directories
  * minor improvements to GUI menu layout

Changes in version 2.0.1
------------------------

  * improved timing accuracy of Z80 memory and NICK port accesses (this
    is still not perfect); note that when playing demo files recorded by
    previous releases, the timing may go out of sync because of this
    change
  * DAVE internal sample rate can now be changed with the sound clock
    frequency option
  * removed video memory latency option
  * implemented 'ignore' watchpoints in the debugger; these can be
    defined by using the 'i' suffix. Watchpoints and single step mode
    will not stop the emulation and open the debugger while the program
    counter is at any address for which the ignore flag is set
  * added I/O tab to the debugger (displays the state of I/O registers)
  * the disassembler now supports the undocumented SLL instruction, and
    also prints RST 30 as 'EXOS nn'
  * added 'step over' button to the debugger; it is similar to 'step',
    but when encountering any subroutine call or looping instructions,
    it will continue program execution until the subroutine returns or
    the loop is finished
  * disassembly view address is automatically updated when the debugger
    is opened by a watchpoint being triggered or using the step buttons;
    the current tab is also remembered and not changed to 'general'
  * new 't' debugger command for copying memory
  * added limited (read-only) support for EPTE/TAPir format tape files
  * fixed direct floppy disk access on Windows
  * improved autodetection of disk geometry parameters; with a disk
    image that contains a FAT filesystem, none of the parameters need to
    be specified explicitly (all can be set to -1)
  * added workaround for FLTK bug that resulted in the right shift key
    being interpreted as left shift on Windows
  * various minor improvements in the software video driver, such as
    reduced aliasing when using a display resolution of 1152x864, and
    slightly lower CPU usage with exact integer scaling ratios (i.e.
    resolutions 384x288, 768x576, 1152x864, and 1536x1152 with the pixel
    aspect ratio set to 1.0)
  * when loading large ROM images, the GUI now automatically sets the
    file name and offset for all segments
  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 2.0.0
------------------------

  * removed Plus/4 emulation (moved to a separate plus4emu project)
  * implemented new video mode that resamples the video output to the
    refresh rate of the monitor; enabling this allows smoother display
    update at the expense of higher CPU usage and some latency in the
    video output
  * screenshots can be saved in 8-bit RLE compressed TGA format
  * quick loading of clock frequency and timing configuration presets
    with PageUp/PageDown keys (useful for switching between normal and
    fast Z80 speed)
  * virtual file I/O can be disabled in the machine configuration
  * bug fixes in NICK emulation
  * attempt to fix OpenGL crash that occurs on some machines
  * added some hacks to the audio driver to reduce timing jitter on
    Windows; this still needs improvements
  * various minor bug fixes

Changes in version 2.0.0 beta1 (since version 1.6.1)
----------------------------------------------------

  * graphical user interface using the FLTK library
  * a GUI debugger with support for listing CPU registers, memory dump,
    disassembly, setting watchpoints, and more
  * new audio and video drivers with more features and improved quality
  * new ROM module that implements a FILE: EXOS device for direct file
    access
  * improved tape emulation
  * demo recording (snapshot and keyboard events stored in a file)
  * external joystick emulation (using the numeric keypad)
  * various internal code changes to allow for the emulation of multiple
    machine types
  * added Commodore Plus/4 emulator mode with high accuracy and support
    for SID emulation, as well as 1541 and 1581 floppy drives
