Changes in version 2.0.5
------------------------

  * changed the debugger window layout so that there is a larger window
    with only two tabs; also more information is displayed, and the
    mouse wheel can be used for scrolling the disassembly and memory
    dump views
  * implemented Lua scripting in the debugger; this makes it possible to
    write complex rules for breakpoints, but can have other uses as
    well, since the script can read and write memory, I/O ports, and CPU
    registers, in addition to having access to the standard Lua library
    functions
  * added a simple monitor to the debugger; the supported commands
    include assemble, disassemble, trace, memory and I/O port dump and
    modify, printing and changing CPU registers, memory compare, copy,
    fill, search, load and save, and more (use ? to print the list of
    available commands, or ? N for help on command N)
  * improved the audio quality of AVI recording, at the expense of
    making it somewhat slower
  * added new command line option for selecting the GUI style and colors
  * a few minor bug fixes and improvements

Changes in version 2.0.4
------------------------

  * keyboard map can be configured with the GUI
  * external game devices like joysticks and gamepads are supported, and
    can be assigned in the keyboard map like normal keys
  * video and audio output can be recorded to AVI files
  * it is now possible to use audio files (WAV, AIFF, etc.) as tape
    images, with support for all tape features except markers; a simple
    linear phase FIR filter can also be applied to the input signal
  * improved television vertical sync emulation
  * new command line option for loading a snapshot or demo file on
    start-up
  * added hue shift to the display options
  * emulation speed percentage and floppy drive LEDs are now displayed
    on the GUI; it is also possible to change the emulation speed
  * various minor bug fixes and improvements

Changes in version 2.0.3
------------------------

  * fixed interrupts in Spectrum emulator
  * other minor fixes, including changes to allow for compiling with
    Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

Changes in version 2.0.2
------------------------

  * implemented Spectrum emulator
  * implemented real time clock
  * in the default keyboard map, Home can also be used now as HOLD, and
    End as STOP; the original keys (Pause/Break and PrintScreen/SysRq)
    did not work on some machines
  * keyboard matrix state is no longer cleared on soft reset
  * NICK registers are initialized to random values on start-up
  * added new ROM images and machine configuration presets
  * the makecfg utility now asks for an installation directory if
    started without command line arguments, and automatically creates
    directories
  * minor improvements to GUI menu layout

Changes in version 2.0.1
------------------------

  * improved timing accuracy of Z80 memory and NICK port accesses (this
    is still not perfect); note that when playing demo files recorded by
    previous releases, the timing may go out of sync because of this
    change
  * DAVE internal sample rate can now be changed with the sound clock
    frequency option
  * removed video memory latency option
  * implemented 'ignore' watchpoints in the debugger; these can be
    defined by using the 'i' suffix. Watchpoints and single step mode
    will not stop the emulation and open the debugger while the program
    counter is at any address for which the ignore flag is set
  * added I/O tab to the debugger (displays the state of I/O registers)
  * the disassembler now supports the undocumented SLL instruction, and
    also prints RST 30 as 'EXOS nn'
  * added 'step over' button to the debugger; it is similar to 'step',
    but when encountering any subroutine call or looping instructions,
    it will continue program execution until the subroutine returns or
    the loop is finished
  * disassembly view address is automatically updated when the debugger
    is opened by a watchpoint being triggered or using the step buttons;
    the current tab is also remembered and not changed to 'general'
  * new 't' debugger command for copying memory
  * added limited (read-only) support for EPTE/TAPir format tape files
  * fixed direct floppy disk access on Windows
  * improved autodetection of disk geometry parameters; with a disk
    image that contains a FAT filesystem, none of the parameters need to
    be specified explicitly (all can be set to -1)
  * added workaround for FLTK bug that resulted in the right shift key
    being interpreted as left shift on Windows
  * various minor improvements in the software video driver, such as
    reduced aliasing when using a display resolution of 1152x864, and
    slightly lower CPU usage with exact integer scaling ratios (i.e.
    resolutions 384x288, 768x576, 1152x864, and 1536x1152 with the pixel
    aspect ratio set to 1.0)
  * when loading large ROM images, the GUI now automatically sets the
    file name and offset for all segments
  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 2.0.0
------------------------

  * removed Plus/4 emulation (moved to a separate plus4emu project at
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/plus4emu/)
  * implemented new video mode that resamples the video output to the
    refresh rate of the monitor; enabling this allows smoother display
    update at the expense of higher CPU usage and some latency in the
    video output
  * screenshots can be saved in 8-bit RLE compressed TGA format
  * quick loading of clock frequency and timing configuration presets
    with PageUp/PageDown keys (useful for switching between normal and
    fast Z80 speed)
  * virtual file I/O can be disabled in the machine configuration
  * bug fixes in NICK emulation
  * attempt to fix OpenGL crash that occurs on some machines
  * added some hacks to the audio driver to reduce timing jitter on
    Windows; this still needs improvements
  * various minor bug fixes

Changes in version 2.0.0 beta1 (since version 1.6.1)
----------------------------------------------------

  * graphical user interface using the FLTK library
  * a GUI debugger with support for listing CPU registers, memory dump,
    disassembly, setting watchpoints, and more
  * new audio and video drivers with more features and improved quality
  * new ROM module that implements a FILE: EXOS device for direct file
    access
  * improved tape emulation
  * demo recording (snapshot and keyboard events stored in a file)
  * external joystick emulation (using the numeric keypad)
  * various internal code changes to allow for the emulation of multiple
    machine types
  * added Commodore Plus/4 emulator mode with high accuracy and support
    for SID emulation, as well as 1541 and 1581 floppy drives
